# CNRD Development Log

## Version 0.1.5 Implementation - Code Consistency Review (2025-04-12)

### Code Structure Improvements
- Standardized import statements across all modules with consistent ordering
- Implemented Path objects from pathlib for cross-platform path handling
- Removed redundant imports and organized import sections for clarity
- Improved module dependency management by using local imports where appropriate

### Error Handling Enhancements
- Ensured consistent error handling patterns across all modules
- Added more robust path handling for config and save files
- Fixed potential circular import issues in the module architecture
- Improved error logging with more descriptive messages

### Technical Debt Reduction
- Refactored directory creation to use Path objects consistently
- Streamlined file load/save operations with consistent patterns
- Better organization of module dependencies for easier future expansion
- Refined import structures to support future testing and modularity

### Planned for Next Update (Version 0.2.0)
- Implement full unit test coverage for all modules
- Refactor Player and Daemon classes for better inheritance structure
- Add in-game documentation system for daemon types and programs
- Improve combat balance with more sophisticated AI decision making
- Add persistent achievements and player statistics tracking
- Create a simple GUI interface option using a standard library module

## Version 0.1.4 - Bug Fixes and Combat System (2025-04-05)

### Fixed Issues
- Fixed critical error in combat system where TYPE_CHART and STATUS_EFFECTS were undefined
- Added proper imports in game.py to reference constants from daemon module
- Resolved crash in combat type effectiveness calculations

### Technical Improvements
- Improved code organization with proper module imports
- Enhanced error recovery in combat system
- Improved code reuse by properly sharing constants between modules

### Planned for Next Update (Version 0.2.0)
- Add more wild daemon spawns in different areas
- Implement NPC trainers with fixed daemon rosters
- Enhance type effectiveness system with more visual feedback
- Add inventory system with healing items
- Implement daemon evolution based on level or special conditions
- Add new locations with special encounters

## Version 0.1.3 - Code Review and Fixes (Implemented)

### Fixed Issues
- Added robust error handling for malformed JSON files with detailed error messages
- Implemented schema validation for configuration files
  - Added validation for daemon, program, and location schemas
  - Added fallback to default data when validation fails
- Fixed critical bug in daemon.to_dict() method causing status_effect serialization issues
- Fixed bug in Player.display_status() that caused crash when called without world_map
- Standardized logging approach throughout data_manager.py
- Added comprehensive unit tests for configuration loading and validation in tests/test_data_manager.py

### Technical Improvements
- Made error messages more informative with line and column numbers for JSON parsing errors
- Enhanced Player and Daemon serialization with better error handling
- Added robust validation for config files before using them
- Created proper testing framework for future development

## Version 0.1.2 - Configuration Update

### New Features
- Moved all hardcoded data to external JSON configuration files:
  - `config/daemons.json`: Contains all daemon base stats
  - `config/programs.json`: Contains all program definitions
  - `config/locations.json`: Contains world map and location data
- Created automatic configuration system that:
  - Creates config files if they don't exist
  - Always loads from config files when available
  - Falls back to defaults only when necessary
- Added config directory creation to bootstrap.py startup process

### Technical Improvements
- Refactored data loading code in data_manager.py
- Removed hardcoded data from game.py
- Cleaned up daemon.py class implementation
- Enhanced configuration management with proper error handling
- Improved code modularity by centralizing data loading

## Version 0.1.1 - Stability Update (Current)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash that occurred after entering player name
- Fixed variable scope issues in game.py main() function
- Added improved error handling in data_manager.py
- Added validation to player location initialization
- Ensured all required directories exist on startup

### New Features
- Added comprehensive logging system
  - Logs stored in "logs" directory with timestamp
  - Different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
  - Console and file logging simultaneously
- Created bootstrap.py for safer startup
  - Global exception handling
  - Crash reporting
  - Pre-flight checks for required directories

### Technical Improvements
- Added detailed exception handling throughout the codebase
- Better validation of save/load operations
- More informative error messages for troubleshooting
- Created development log for tracking changes

## How to Run the Game

The game can be started in two ways:

1. Using bootstrap.py (recommended):
   ```
   python bootstrap.py
   ```
   This runs the game with error catching and creates all necessary directories.

2. Using game.py directly (for development):
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

## Known Issues

- Combat balance needs adjustment
- Limited set of wild Daemons available
- No inventory system implemented yet

## Future Plans

- Implement improved combat type advantages
- Add more locations and Daemons
- Add inventory and item system
- Create proper NPC trainers and dialogue system
