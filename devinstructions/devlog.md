# CNRD Prototype Development Log

## 2025-04-12: Fixed Simulated Combat Testing

Successfully fixed issues with the combat testing system:

1. **Fixed Program and Daemon Initialization in Test Framework**:
   - Updated the `test_combat.py` file to correctly initialize the `Program` class with required parameters (`id` and `description`)
   - Fixed `Daemon` initialization by replacing the `base_stats` dictionary with individual base stat parameters
   - Ensured proper logging directory creation for automated combat tests

2. **Combat Simulation Logging Improvements**:
   - Fixed the logging system for simulated combat to properly create log files
   - Enhanced the structured logging format to include timestamps and detailed combat events
   - Added verification to ensure log files are properly created and written
   - Test now reports the location of generated log files for easier inspection

3. **Updated Testing Framework**:
   - Enhanced automated battle system testing with more robust combat simulation
   - Fixed mock input system to properly simulate user combat decisions
   - Added detailed assertions to verify combat mechanics are functioning correctly
   - Implemented comprehensive testing for various battle scenarios

### Next Steps
- Review the main game codebase to ensure combat works properly in the standard game
- Verify program assignment and daemon initialization in the main game matches the test fixes
- Test standard combat flow with player starter daemons
- Add additional validation and error handling for combat initialization
- Consider implementing more comprehensive logging for the main game combat system

## 2025-04-11: Bug Fix - Combat System Program Assignment

Fixed a critical issue with combat where daemons had no programs assigned, making it impossible to fight:

1. **Fixed Daemon Initialization**: Updated the `create_daemon` function to properly load programs from the program data into newly created daemons.
   - Ensured the learnset in daemon data is correctly processed
   - Fixed program assignment logic for starter and wild daemons
   - Added fallback default programs for all daemons to ensure they always have at least one attack

2. **Program Data Verification**: Added validation to check that programs defined in learnsets actually exist in the program database.
   - Added logging for missing program definitions
   - Implemented default program assignment when learnset data is invalid

3. **Testing**: Added comprehensive test cases to verify:
   - All starter daemons have at least one program
   - Daemons created at various levels have appropriate programs
   - Combat can be successfully initiated and programs can be selected

These changes ensure that all daemons, including starters and wild encounters, will have programs available for combat, resolving the issue where players couldn't attack.

### Improvements for Next Update
- Implement Daemon Program learnset tables to ensure consistent program progression
- Add tutorial messages for first-time combat to explain mechanics
- Enhance combat menu UI to show program descriptions before selection
- Add confirmation dialog before initiating trainer battles
- Implement type-based encounter modifiers for the scan command

## 2025-04-07: Combat Initialization Issues Fixed

After analyzing reported problems with combat not initiating properly, I've identified and fixed several issues:

1. **Combat Validation Enhanced**: Fixed a critical bug in combat initialization where the system wasn't properly validating if player daemons had programs assigned before entering combat.
   - Added pre-combat checks to ensure player daemons have at least one program assigned
   - Implemented more robust error handling for "scan" and "act" commands
   - Added detailed logging for failed combat initialization attempts

2. **Player Daemon Health Validation**: Combat now properly checks if player has at least one healthy daemon before initiating encounters:
   - Added validation in all combat entry points (random encounters, scan, act commands)
   - Added helpful error messages when combat can't start due to no healthy daemons
   - Fixed a bug where the game would crash if attempting combat with all daemons at 0 HP

3. **Training Battle Daemon Generation**: Fixed an issue where training battles were failing to generate opponent daemons with proper programs:
   - Training daemons now always spawn with at least 2 appropriate programs
   - Added difficulty scaling that properly adjusts opponent daemon levels
   - Fixed a bug where certain daemon types couldn't be selected for training battles

### Potential Issues to Monitor
- Some rare daemon types might still have inconsistent program assignment
- High-level opponent daemons may occasionally have fewer programs than expected
- Combat difficulty scaling might need additional balancing

### Improvements for Next Update
- Implement Daemon Program learnset tables to ensure consistent program progression
- Add tutorial messages for first-time combat to explain mechanics
- Enhance combat menu UI to show program descriptions before selection
- Add confirmation dialog before initiating trainer battles
- Implement type-based encounter modifiers for the scan command

## 2025-04-06: Crash Prevention & Error Handling Improvements

After reviewing crash reports, we've identified and fixed several critical issues that were causing game instability:

1. Fixed a potential crash in combat state when `current_enemy_daemon` was unexpectedly None, causing the game to attempt accessing properties of a non-existent object
2. Improved error handling in the combat system to properly validate daemon and program availability before combat begins
3. Implemented more robust player location validation to prevent crashes when player.location references an invalid location ID
4. Enhanced the error recovery system to gracefully handle more edge cases, allowing players to continue their game even if certain non-critical errors occur

These changes significantly improve game stability and should prevent the most common crash scenarios reported by testers.

## 2025-04-05: Bug Fix - Starter Programs Missing

Fixed a critical bug where starter daemons were not being assigned any programs, which made combat impossible since daemons couldn't attack. The changes include:

1. Enhanced the `Player.create_starter_daemon()` method to ensure all starter daemons have programs assigned to them.
2. Added a test in `test_combat.py` to verify that all daemons have at least one program assigned.
3. Updated the combat system to properly display available programs during battle.
4. Each starter daemon now comes with two programs:
   - Virulet: "Data Corruption" (damage) and "Memory Leak" (status effect)
   - Pyrowall: "Packet Block" (damage) and "Port Shield" (defense boost)
   - Aquabyte: "Hash Collision" (damage) and "Key Scramble" (status effect)

These changes ensure players can now properly engage in combat from the start of the game.

## 2025-04-04: Bug Report - Combat System Issue

Identified a critical bug in the combat system where daemons cannot attack because they have no programs assigned. During training combat:
- Users are prompted to select a program during combat
- The system shows "No programs available!" for all starter daemons
- This makes combat impossible as the player cannot take any offensive actions
- Issue confirmed with the Virulet starter daemon, likely affects all starters

Issue needs immediate attention as it breaks core gameplay functionality.
