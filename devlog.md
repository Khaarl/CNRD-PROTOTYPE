## 2023-11-15: Game.py Module Implementation

Added the core game.py module which serves as the main game loop and gameplay controller. This is a significant milestone as it brings together the various components of the CNRD game.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Pygame Integration**: Implemented a graphical interface using Pygame with a resolution of 800x600
- **Game States**: Added state management with primary states:
  - `roaming`: Player navigating the world map
  - `combat`: Turn-based battle sequence
  - Game state transitions controlled by player actions and events

- **Combat System**:
  - Turn-based combat with sub-states (player_choose_action, player_choose_program, player_action_execute, enemy_turn, etc.)
  - Type effectiveness calculations based on the TYPE_CHART
  - Status effects handling (CORRUPTED, FRAGMENTED, LOCKED)
  - XP gain and level-up handling when defeating enemies
  - Combat log for battle messages

- **UI Rendering**:
  - Location information display with description and available exits
  - Combat interface with HP bars, status indicators, and action menus
  - Text rendering helper functions for consistent display

- **Event Handling**:
  - Keyboard input processing based on game state
  - Movement controls in roaming mode (arrow keys)
  - Combat action selection (F-fight, S-switch, C-capture, R-run)

- **Random Encounters**:
  - Encounter chance based on location's encounter_rate
  - Wild daemon generation with appropriate level scaling
  - Combat initiation on successful encounter roll

- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful state recovery for unexpected combat situations
  - Logging of errors and state transitions for debugging

### Technical Implementation Notes

- **Code Organization**:
  - Helper functions for drawing UI elements
  - Combat sub-state handlers for modular combat flow
  - Global variables for shared state (combat_log, game_state, etc.)

- **Integration Points**:
  - Uses daemon.py for daemon creation and combat mechanics
  - Uses player.py for player state and inventory management
  - Uses data_manager.py for save/load functionality
  - Uses location.py for world navigation

- **Known Limitations**:
  - Switch daemon functionality partially implemented
  - Capture mechanic needs refinement
  - Training battle needs adaptation for Pygame UI

### Next Steps

- Implement switching of daemons during combat
- Complete capture mechanics with proper UI feedback
- Add proper menu system for game options
- Implement save/load UI
- Enhance the visual feedback for combat actions

## Future Planned Features

- Add NPC trainers with predefined daemon teams
- Implement inventory system for items
- Add more sophisticated AI for enemy decision making
- Create experience sharing system for inactive daemons
- Design and implement an achievement system
